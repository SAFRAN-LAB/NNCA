# TODO list
## Major things (must be done)
1. Add CUDA
2. We may also accelerate the "Testing period" as well. Give it a try.

## Minor things to improve
1. Add functions to read csv or excel. Better to create some essential features as Pandas library.
2. Create some functions to visulize the support vectors (also the hyper-surface). Give it a try with GNUPlot. Or export the details and plot using Python.
