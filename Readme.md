This library was created by Vaishnavi Gujjula, during the course of her Ph.D.

This library constructs a H2 matrix representation of a given matrix using NNCA. Further it demonstrates
  i) the performance of the fast H2 matrix vector product using NNCA in 2D, 3D, and nD
  ii) the performance of fast kernel based SVM, where the matrix vector products encountered are accelerated using NNCA.
